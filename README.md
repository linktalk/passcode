# Password Derivation

## Where is the service?
[Password Derivation | One Passcode, No Password](https://linktalk.github.io/passcode/)

## Where does it come from?
- I really don't want to use the same password for various accounts.
- I'm readlly not able to remember so much account passwords.
- I really don't want to remember complicated passwords.

## What's the solution then?
1. Choose and remember one simple passcode.
2. Choose and remember a simple slogna of your own.
3. Derivate password for each account with the passcode and slogan.
4. Use the password and forgot it.
5. Repeat 3-4 if you need the password again.

## What's the benefit?
- Only one static HTML, no data transfer to server.
- Only need to remember one simple passcode, and a slogan you prefer
- Generating password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.
- As if you enter the same parameters (passcode, solgan, account domain, account username), the generated passwords are always the same. 
- There is no need to remember the generated passwords.  Instead, generate, copy and past it for your login.
